  <p> Goku, otherwise known as Kakarot, is the main male protagonist of the hit anime series Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, and the ongoing Dragon Ball Super. He is a Saiyan, a humanoid alien sent from Planet Vegeta to conquer the Earth. However, an accident occurs and is raised as a kind-hearted boy who ventures outdoors with much gusto. Each series centers around his outlandish adventures stemming from the seven wish-granting orbs known as "Dragon Balls". Throughout these adventures Goku matures into a valiant defender of Earth, while still retaining his lax personality. Accompanying him are some of the friends he makes along the way, even converting former enemies, such as his rival Vegeta, into friends with charisma. To deal with any nefarious foes, Goku taps into his Saiyan cells and fights at incredible speeds using ki blasts and a ever so famous transformation- Super Saiyan. </p>
