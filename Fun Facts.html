  <h1>Fun Facts</h1> 

  <font face="verdana" color="black"> 

    <LI>Akira Toriyama, the creator and supervisor of the Dragon Ball manga, anime, and spinoffs, is worth $50 million USD. That's a lot of dough for a anime creator!</LI>
    <LI>Over $5 Billion USD worth of official Dragon Ball merchandise has been sold worldwide.</LI>
    <LI>Goku is one of the most powerful characters in all of Dragon Ball lore, having achieved a new form in Dragon Ball Super called "Ultra Instinct". He has now surpassed all but the two highest gods in the Dragon Ball multiverse. This form sports a omnipotent strength far greater than the universal destroying capacities of Goku's lesser god-based Super Saiyan forms.</LI>
    <LI>Dragon Ball Z is the #1 best selling anime franchise of all time. According to Nielsen VideoScan, over 25 million DVDs & Blu-rays have been sold in the U.S alone. Accompanying this is the sale of over 55 million Dragon Ball branded videogames have been sold across the globe.</LI>
    <LI> The original Dragon Ball manga and by extension, future manga and anime installments, were based on a revered 16th century Chinese legend called Journey to the West. The main character, Sun Wukong, is homogenous to Goku in ideals and adventures.</LI>
    <LI>The most frequent Dragon Ball video on the video sharing platform Youtube was produced by a channel called ERB. <A HREF="<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0MW9Nrg_kZU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> The video </A> featured Goku and Superman engaging in a rap battle, with their respective fandoms continuing incessant debates as to the qualitative features of each character. It garnered over 78 million views.
    <LI>Even a series with a pedrigree like Dragon Ball's is susceptible to the meme world. The most notorious example involving the line "It's Over 9,000!", wherein then foes Nappa and Vegeta were made privy to Goku's ki energy level. This is a result of a mistranslation, as the original manga and anime in Japan had these villains stating "It's Over 8000!"</LI>
    <LI>Masako Nozawa, the Japanese voice actor for Goku, was bestowed with Guiness World Records for (1) the longest time voicing a single character in videogames (2) the longest period of time working as a voice actor in videogames. This is, of course, attributable to her having voiced characters in Dragon Ball games for 23 years and 218 days!</LI>
    <LI> <A HREF="http://houseofinfographics.com/karakter-dragon-ball/"> Nearly all of the Saiyans in Dragon Ball owe their name to food puns. </A> Goku's real Saiyan name is Kakarot, which is a clear derivative of "carrot". Likewise, his brother Raditz is named after "radish", frenemy Vegeta after "vegetables", and bloodthirsty enemy Broly after "broccoli."
    <LI> Japan's government formally elected to fund around 50 Million Japanese Yen($600,000 USD) towards the development of the 2013 Dragon Ball Z comeback movie: Battle of Gods.</LI>
    <LI>During the English dubbing of Dragon Ball GT in North American, Goku's voice actor Sean Schemmel passed out during a recording session. Performing Goku's first powerup into the Super Saiyan 4 form, a mixture of exhaustion and overexertion caused Mr. Schemmel to pass out for a few seconds!</LI>
    <LI> The Super Saiyan transformation is arguably the most iconic representation besides Goku himself, yet it arose out of a need for simplicity in the manga. Goku's base form, for instance required the full hair piece to be filled in with black ink. Super Saiyan's hair color was represented by blank space, which was later changed into blonde and so forth for the anime. This technique, developed by Akira Toriyama and his assistant, allowed them to save time in the tedious process of coloring in hair at the time. </LI>
